auto-cashout feature.\*\* This feature allows you to set a specific
multiplier at which you want to cash out. This can help you to avoid
losing your winnings if the plane flies away before you have a chance to
cash out. \* \*\*Bet small amounts.\*\* This will help you to minimize
your losses if the plane flies away before you have a chance to cash
out. \* \*\*Don\'t chase your losses.\*\* If you lose a few rounds in a
